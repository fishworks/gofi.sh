MacOS/Linux:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishworks/gofish/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (Powershell, as Administrator):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishworks/gofish/main/scripts/install.ps1'))

After running one of the install scripts:

```
gofish init

Once you have GoFish up and running, you can upgrade at any time using

```
gofish install gofish
```

Then:

```
gofish upgrade gofish
```

Please inspect the install scripts prior to running them to ensure your OS's safety. I trust my own code, but you should verify the security and contents of any script from the internet you are not familiar with.
